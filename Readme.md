Description
-
This project is VR Template on C++ for PICO 4.

P.S.
- 
- Blueprints based on C++ code are located in the BP_CPP folder
- The PICO Preview Plugin was used for this work. Now it is disabled. When it is turned on, build the project through sources. You will most likely have an error related to a piece of code inside the engine (I had an error in a piece of code with Lumen labeled "deprecated in UE 5.2" in version 5.2). Comment out this whole piece of code, and you will get the plugin running without errors. It took me a long time to deal with this situation.
- Don't forget the PICO Developer Center (to test the connection and the PICO Preview Plugin works).
